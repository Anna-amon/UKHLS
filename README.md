## Life Satisfaction in the UK - Data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study

This report is the beginning of a research piece considering life satisfaction in the UK, and forms the first section of the exploratory analysis.
 
### Dependent Variables

The UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) uses the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) to assess wellbeing. The wellbeing measure used in this research will be the answers to the 12 questions, summed up to give a scale of 0 (least distressed) to 36 (most distressed). In this research the variable has been re-coded, with a score of 0 indicating the most distress, and 36 the least distress. 

### Wellbeing, Life Satisfaction and the U-shaped curve

Data from the UKHLS GHQ scale shows a change in wellbeing by age, from 2009 through to 2022. You can visualise this using their dashboard: https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/wellbeing-dashboard/. 

In Waves 1 to 9 (2009 – 2017), the data shows individuals as having higher wellbeing from ages 16-34, with a decline from ages 35-54 and then another increase from ages 55-99. This is known as the U-shaped curve. From Wave 9 to Wave 13 (2017 – 2022), the data shows a trend change; rather than a U-shape, the trend line appears linear. Individuals’ wellbeing increases with age, the lowest wellbeing seen in 16–34-year-olds, followed by an increase in wellbeing for those aged 35-54 and the highest average wellbeing remaining for those aged 55-99. 

The analysis completed for the purposes of this report is using the 2021 dataset. We can see the same trend within this one year, in the graph below. This analysis has more granular age groups, therefore those ages 16-19 show a slight increase from those aged 20-34. 

For the purpose of this analysis, the focus will be on the factors influencing life satisfaction. We are therefore less interested in why life satisfaction changes with age, and what the different factors are influencing high or low life satisfaction within each age group.

### Life Satisfaction and Satisfaction with Health, Income and Leisure Time

Having considered life satisfaction by age, we can now consider satisfaction with income, health and leisure time. The graph below visualises the results. Satisfaction with income, leisure time and life overall appear to potentially be correlated. A correlation matrix and heat-map may be used to consider this further. Interestingly, a decline in physical health past aged 60 years does not seem to result in lower life satisfaction, it is actually the opposite.
